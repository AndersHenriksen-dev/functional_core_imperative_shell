Build domain pipelines with explicit contracts, consistent IO, and repeatable runs. This site documents how the system works and how to extend it.

## Start here

- Read [Getting Started](getting_started.md) for the quickest setup.
- Follow the [User Guide](user_guide.md) for architecture and configuration.
- Copy recipes from [Examples](examples.md).
- Browse the [API Reference](api/index) when you need details.

## What this project solves

- Centralize IO definitions and validation in one place.
- Keep domain logic testable and isolated from orchestration.
- Validate reads and writes with Pandera schemas.

## How it is organized

- **Domains** own business logic and export a `run` entry point.
- **Contracts** define input and output expectations.
- **IO** utilities read and persist data consistently.
- **Configuration** is validated with Pydantic and composed by Hydra.
- **Orchestration** wires everything together with `run_domains`.
